# RockPaperScissors_Game
This is a simple console game written for project in Programming Fundamentals course in SoftUni.

The game itself has a simple rules. Each player choose one of the options - Rock, Paper or Scissors, like Rock beats Scissor, Scissors beats Paper and Paper beats Rock.

This particular game is played 3 of 5 rounds.
I used While Loop for each round.
